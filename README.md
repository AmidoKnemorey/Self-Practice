# Self-Practice
So these are my first works with Java and programming in general. Hence, be carefull, probably you'll meet some new magic and awesome things from the newbie.
Within "src/SingleClassWorks_1/" are elementary single class tasks, just in case. 
Within "src/SingleClassWorks_2/" are single-class tasks too but little of bit more interesting.
Within "src/FirstMiniProjects/ATM" is mini project that simulates of cash dispencer or just FirstMiniProjects.ATM.
Within "src/FirstMiniProjects/BicyclesRentalAnalysis/" is project that reads one file from "WRM System", the file with info about many quantity of trips in bicycles. Read about that system in google.
Sometimes I leave my own comments in Russian or Polish language in code.
